            <p>This website was made to help guide people through my Minecraft playthrough, it features the important   functionalities which I need when playing Minecraft, for example, the Notebook function, which proves useful to   me as I can do tasks such as taking down notes of locations, to do in the future, what I urgently need, etc...    <br>The Resource Calculator function is also very useful to me as I can calculate how much materials I need to  craft an item without going through the hassle of calculating it manualy.</p>

                    <p>In this page is where I used my own knowledge I learnt from online javascript courses to create a resource calculator which will help users calculate how much resources they need to craft an item.<br>Each item has different crafting formula and different resources, therefore each item will have it's own equation.<br>This page taught me how to use javascript to manipulate DOM in order to create a more functional website rather than pure HTML and CSS, which allowed me to improve my creativity when making websites.</p>
